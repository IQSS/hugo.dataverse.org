## Try the Dataverse software

You are very welcome to try the Dataverse software at https://demo.dataverse.org or (for the brave of heart) https://beta.dataverse.org! The demo server runs our latest [release](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases) while the beta server runs unreleased software just merged [on GitHub](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse).üöÄ

Feedback is a gift.üéÅ Please tell us what you like and don't like on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community) or [Zulip](https://dataverse.zulipchat.com). Or email us privately at support@dataverse.org. Thanks!

## Installing the software

Our [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/index.html) will help you install the server-side Dataverse software. (An experimental [Docker installation](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/container/running/demo.html) is also available.) Please [reach out](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/intro.html#getting-help) if you have any difficulty.

Client-side software includes uploaders in [Java](https://github.com/GlobalDataverseCommunityConsortium/dataverse-uploader) and [Python](https://github.com/gdcc/python-dvuploader) as well as [API client libraries](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/client-libraries.html) in Python, JavaScript, R, Julia, Rust, Go, and more!

## Free research data hosting with Harvard Dataverse

## Finding research data

To find research data you can try [DataCite](https://commons.datacite.org), [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com), and [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org). Many of the installations of Dataverse around the world make their data [searchable](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/discoverability.html) in these platforms.

Alternatively, you can search [Dataverse installations](https://iqss.github.io/dataverse-installations/) individually.

Some Dataverse installations harvest metadata from each other (and non-Dataverse data repositories), making datasets more discoverable across the Dataverse network and the broader data-sharing ecosystem. [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu) is one of these.

## Joining the community

We have a large, friendly, growing [community](/community). Please feel free to browse through discussions on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community), [Zulip](https://dataverse.zulipchat.com), and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues). You are welcome to join our monthly [community calls](https://dataverse.org/community-calls), watch some [DataverseTV](https://iqss.github.io/dataverse-tv/), and read the [Dataverse Community News](https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community?label=community_news).
