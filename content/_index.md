*Installations of the Dataverse software from [countries](https://iqss.github.io/dataverse-installations/bycountry.html) all over the world. More [details](https://iqss.github.io/dataverse-installations/).*

## Try the Dataverse software

You are very welcome to try the Dataverse software at https://demo.dataverse.org or (for the brave of heart) https://beta.dataverse.org! The demo server runs our latest [release](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases) while the beta server runs unreleased software just merged [on GitHub](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse).üöÄ

Feedback is a gift.üéÅ Please tell us what you like and don't like on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community) or [Zulip](https://dataverse.zulipchat.com). Or email us privately at support@dataverse.org. Thanks!

## Installing the software

Our [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/index.html) will help you install the Dataverse software. Be sure to consider using [dataverse-ansible](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-ansible). Please [reach out](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/intro.html#getting-help) if you have any difficulty. Feedback on our experimental [Docker-based installation](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/container/running/demo.html) is especially welcome.

Additionally, client-side software is available, such as uploaders in [Java](https://github.com/GlobalDataverseCommunityConsortium/dataverse-uploader) and [Python](https://github.com/gdcc/python-dvuploader), various [integrations](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/integrations.html) and [apps](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/apps.html), and [API client libraries](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/client-libraries.html) in Python, JavaScript, R, Julia, Rust, Go, and more!

## Free research data hosting with Harvard Dataverse

If you are looking for free research data hosting, one of the many Dataverse [installations](#dataverse-installations-around-the-world) around the world can help (within [limits](https://support.dataverse.harvard.edu/researchers)): [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu).

[![Harvard Dataverse logo](/hdvlogo.png)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu)

You can read the [story](about) of how the Dataverse software was created at and continues to be lead by Harvard's [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu) (IQSS) with incredible support from the [community](#joining-the-community).

## Finding research data

To find research data you can try [DataCite](https://commons.datacite.org), [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com), and [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org). Many of the [installations](#dataverse-installations-around-the-world) of Dataverse around the world make their data [searchable](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/discoverability.html) in these platforms.

Alternatively, you can search [Dataverse installations](#dataverse-installations-around-the-world) individually. üîç

Some Dataverse installations harvest metadata from each other (and non-Dataverse data repositories), making datasets more discoverable across the Dataverse network and the broader data-sharing ecosystem. [Harvard Dataverse](#free-research-data-hosting-with-harvard-dataverse) is one of these.

## Joining the community

We have a large, friendly, growing [community](/community).
